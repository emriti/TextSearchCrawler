# ClassTextCrawler
Small application to search some word of C# class files.

## How to use
- Open Program.cs
- Change "inFolder" to your C# project folder
- Change "outFile" to output file of the app
- Change "searchWord" to your searching keyword
- Change "delimiter" to your delimiter

## Troubleshooting
- When I opened the csv on the excel, some of the data's column is on different excel's column
	- Make sure you update default delimiter on your OS, make it same as the delimiter of the app
